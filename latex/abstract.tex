\noindent In implementing parallelised architectures, FIFO queues can play an important role as communication channels
between different application components\cite{WangCheng2009}.
These communication channels can often be core to the performance of such applications, particularly network
applications which often make use of pipeline parallelism\cite{Upadhyaya2007,WangCheng2009}.
However, there are many different SPSC FIFO queue implementations and each paper benchmarks their queue
differently, making it hard to compare results between them.
For this reason it is difficult to determine the optimal choice of queue for an application without implementing and
testing all of the considered options.
I seek to alleviate this problem by building a benchmarking framework, which should allow for easier
benchmarking of a wide range of queues and help future authors of papers presenting novel queue designs to
benchmark their newly proposed implementations in a replicable and comparable manner.
I make use of this framework to test a range of different queues: B-Queue, EQueue, FastForward Queue,
FastFlow Queue, Lamport Queue and MCRingBuffer \cite{B-Queue,EQueue,FastForward,FastFlowGithub,Lamport,MCRingBuffer}.
In the benchmarks used here FastForward Queue, FastFlow Queue, and MCRingBuffer were consistently (among) the
best performing queues.
I also compared my results with some of those of the EQueue, B-Queue, and FastForward papers and found that
they are similar, but not identical.
Furthermore, I published all source code used for this benchmarking, along with detailed contextual information,
in order to make my results as simple to replicate as possible.
