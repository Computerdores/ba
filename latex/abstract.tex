    \begin{itemize}
        \item should summarise whole work not just intro stuff
        \item most important points:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item What's the problem?
                \item Why is it relevant?
                \item Why is unsolved? (if work has already been done, why not enough)
                \item What do I want to contribute?
                \item What was the result of that?
            \end{itemize}
