\section*{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
    \item parallelisation of applications is an important technique for reaching performance goals
    \item FIFO queues can play an important role here as communication channels between application components
    \item these channels can be core to the performance of applications, particularly network applications
        where the rate of incoming packets can be quite high, performance of these queues can thus be critical
    \item many different SPSC FIFO queue implementations
    \item each paper benchmarks differently, hard to compare
    \item hard to know which queue is best for particular use case
    \item I tested the performance of six queues: BQueue, EQueue, FastForwardQ, FastFlowQ, LamportQ, MCRingBuffer
    \item built benchmarking framework to help future authors make their work more replicable and comparable
        by making my code easy to extend
    \item I tested the performance of those queues, result is that FFLWQ is most consistently very good
    \item my results partially line up, partially don't with EQ/BQ/FFWD papers
    \item I published all source code and as many details as possible, my results should therefore be much easier to reproduce
    \item framework is done, modular, and should be easy to extend
\end{itemize}
