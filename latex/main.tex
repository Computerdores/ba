\section{framework}
\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparing results of different papers is diffcult
    \item Often no / only partial source code for the benchmarks
    \item I make everything available (\todo{embed archive of repo})
    \item benchmarks differ a lot between papers

    \item should be easy to extend (another queue, different enqueue behaviour, etc.)
    \item want to avoid duplicating the entire benchmark for every queue/variation in a part of the benchmark
    \item EQueue: parts of queue impl in benchmark code => full separation
    \item don't want to give up on the compiler opt advantage of doing so
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Runner class as a skeleton benchmark
    \item populated with templated components
    \item components defined in headers
    \item => get inlined (verified in Ghidra)
    \item => almost identical result of compilation
    \item => no perf diff
    \item (insert runner class or pseudo code of it)
    \item component types:
    \item waiter
        \begin{itemize}
            \item causes a delay between operation
            \item used to emulate different enqueue/dequeue patterns
        \end{itemize}
    \item measurer
        \begin{itemize}
            \item measures time between start and end of operation
            \item can be used to implement differnt ways of measuring time
            \item can also be varied to measure other aspects (cnt failed ops, cache stats, etc.)
        \end{itemize}
    \item queue
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the data structure to be benchmarked
            \item should implement consistent interface
            \item non-blocking ops
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Components}
\subsubsection{Waiters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Constant Wait
        \begin{itemize}
            \item waits a constant amount of time between operations
            \item used to emulate operations (of input / output) that take a very consistent amount of time
        \end{itemize}
    \item Constant Rate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item tries to maintain a constant time difference between starts of operations
            \item used to emulate input streams with a constant rate
        \end{itemize}
    \item Bursty
        \begin{itemize}
            \item defers waits in order to have blocks of BURST\_SIZE elements with no waits
            \item used to emulate enqueue / dequeue behaviour that is bursty
            \item typical for network applications
        \end{itemize}
    \item Jitter can be enabled; adds pseudo-random variance to wait times (also present in FFWDQ paper)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measurers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item can vary timestamp source \todo{add class for that}
    \item can vary whether failed operations reset the start timestamp \todo{move to measurer class}
    \item could measure cache stats for the duration of the operation
\end{itemize}

\section{queue implementations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item equeue: traffic counter mismatch between paper and impl -> compromise?
\end{itemize}

\section{test setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item cycles vs. ns
    \item reproducibility
\end{itemize}
