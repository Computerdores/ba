\section{Source Code Archive}
\label{app:source-code-archive}
As mentioned previously, to assure the preservation of the source code of everything related to this work, it
was embedded into this document as an archive.
The archive can be extracted via the following link: \textattachfile[color=0 0 1]{src.tar.gz}{src.tar.gz}.
Since this is not a commonly used feature of PDF files, it may not work in every PDF viewer.
It was tested and confirmed to work in Firefox version 141.0 on Linux.
