\chapter{Source Code Archive}
\label{app:source-code-archive}
As mentioned previously, to assure the preservation of the source code of everything related to this work,
the complete repository was embedded into this document as an archive.
This also includes analysis reports with the data presented by the figures, among other things.

The archive can be extracted via the following link: \textattachfile[color=0 0 1]{src.tar.gz}{src.tar.gz}.
Since this is not a commonly used feature of PDF files, it may not work in every PDF viewer.
It was tested and confirmed to work in Firefox version 141.0 on Linux.

\chapter{Search Queries}
\label{app:repro-search-queries}
In order to find papers that compare different \acrshort{spsc} \acrshort{fifo} queue implementations,
I performed the following queries using Google Scholar and examined the first five pages of the results for each query:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{SPSC FIFO queue benchmark comparison}
    \item \texttt{FIFO queue "benchmark"}
    \item \texttt{FIFO queue comparison}
    \item \texttt{FIFO queue performance evaluation}
    \item \texttt{"multi-core" "queue" benchmark}
    \item \texttt{B-Queue}
\end{itemize}

These results did not include any papers focusing on comparing different implementations;
however, the results did contain several papers presenting novel queue designs, which may be of future interest:
