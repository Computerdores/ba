\subsection{System Under Test}
\subsubsection{Hardware}
The benchmarks were run on a SuperMicro SYS-521C-NR server with a Intel Xeon Gold 6548N CPU with 32 cores
running at the base frequency of \SI{2.8}{\giga\hertz}.
Each core has \SI{80}{\kilo\byte} of L1 Cache, \SI{2}{\mega\byte} of L2 Cache, and \SI{60}{\mega\byte} of L3
Cache shared among the cores.
The server has \SI{128}{\giga\byte} of DDR5 memory, in a 8x\SI{16}{\giga\byte} configuration running at
\SI{4800}{\mega\transfer\per\second}.
All benchmarks were run with the CPU running at base frequency (set via the \texttt{cpupower} utility).

\subsubsection{Software}
The server was running Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS with Linux Kernel version 6.8.0.
The benchmarks were compiled using gcc 14.2.0.
Kernel parameters were used to isolate the CPU cores used for the benchmark for influences from the rest of the system.
Specifically, the \texttt{isolcpus} and \texttt{nohz\_full} parameters were used.
