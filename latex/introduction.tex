\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item parallelisation of applications is an important technique for reaching performance goals
    \item FIFO queues can play an important role here as communication channels between CPU cores
    \item particularly SPSC FIFO queues are important there
    \item these channels can be core to the performance of applications, particularly network applications
        where the rate of incoming packets can be quite high, performance of these queues can thus be critical
    \item many different SPSC FIFO queue implementations
    \item each paper benchmarks differently, hard to compare
    \item each comes to conclusion that their new queue is the best
    \item hard to know which queue is best for particular use case
    \item wasn't able to find any repro papers \todo{TODO: appendix on what I searched to determine this}
    \item papers rarely provide source code
    \item even then, source code often incomplete or gone missing
    \item a direct replication not possible (see
            \href{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reproducibility/#:~:text=direct
                replication%20%28which%20closely%20follow%20the%20original%20study%20to%20verify%20results%29%20and
                conceptual%20replications%20%28which%20deliberately%20alter%20important%20features%20of%20the%20study
                to%20generalize%20findings%20or%20to%20test%20the%20underlying%20hypothesis%20in%20a%20new%20way%29
        }{plato.standford.edu})
    \item only conceptual reproduction
    \item I test the performance of six queues: BQueue, EQueue, FastForwardQ, FastFlowQ, LamportQ, MCRingBuffer
        \cite{B-Queue}\cite{EQueue}\cite{FastForward}\cite{FastFlowGithub}\cite{Lamport}\cite{MCRingBuffer}
    \item compare to the results from EQ, BQ, FFWD papers
    \item I do so in a manner most similar to how EQ did as they compare the most different
        queues out of the papers of these queues
    \item (Lamport not compared in EQ paper but in FFWDQ paper, included because easy to implement)
    \item to make my results as replicable as possible, I
        \begin{itemize}
            \item released the full source code, both hosted online and embedded into the pdf
                (latter to prevent missing code in the future)
            \item provided, and explained my choice of, all parameters of the tests and queues
            \item provided, and explained the choices made in, all implementations of the queues
        \end{itemize}
    \item built benchmarking framework to help future authors make their work more replicable and comparable
        by making my code easy to extend
\end{itemize}
