\section{conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item future work: more sophisticated analysis (e.g. how full the queues over the runs, how many ops fail, real RX/TX rate)
    \item significant difference between EQueue paper and mine could be due to several reasons:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I suspect data for different burst sizes is from cross cpu test, I only have one cpu
            \item They include part of their measurement code in the time measurements, I don't (not sure how significant this is)
